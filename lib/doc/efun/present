object present(object|string find, void|object env)
.SP 5 5
If an object that identifies to the name find is present, then return it.

find can also be an object, in which case the test is much faster and easier.

The object is searched for in the inventory of the current object, and
in the inventory of the environment of the current object.

The second, optional argument defaults to this_object().
Normally this_player() is a good environment.
