                                   Discworld
                     Where all your dreams can't come true.

                                       
                                 Wombles are:
                              Brandobas   Deutha
                                Titania  Sojan
                                  Blues are:
                                DrGoon   Signe
                           Pinkfish  Ember  Furball
                                       

Please imagine a very nice picture of four Elephants standing on the back of
a Turtle (sex unknown) swimming through space.  On the Elephants rests the
Disc of the world, garlanded by the long waterfall at its vast circumference
and domed by the baby blue vault of heaven.  Imagine this, because there is
not enough room here to draw it.

Based on the Discworld books by Terry Pratchett, please do not choose a
name of one of the characters from these books.
