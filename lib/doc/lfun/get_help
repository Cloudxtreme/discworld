string get_help();

get_help is used for supplying help on an object.  When a player types help
<object>, there are a number of things that are checked.  First, it checks
to see if an object is supplied and if not, it lists the standard help files.
Next, the mud helps to see if find_match(str,this_player()) returns an object
or objects.  If it does, help will then write out the strings returned by
calling get_help on each of the objects.  Basically here is the point at which
you would want to use get_help().

inherit "std/object";

void setup() {
  set_name("test");
  set_short("test");
  set_main_plural("tests");
  set_long("This is the test object.  'help test' for more info.\n");
}

string get_help() {
  return "This is where the extra help goes.\n";
}


Now when the player types:

help test

The mud will respond by printing out the object and the string returned.

Do not add_action("???","help") without good reason.  With this function, you
should never need to.  Also adding commands that are added by the player object
should be avoided where possible.
