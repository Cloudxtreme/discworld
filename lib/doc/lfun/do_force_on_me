int do_force_on_me(string str);

This command is to be defined if an object is to be able to be forced to do
things.  Monsters should define this command.  It is in /std/living/living.c
so you should not need to redefine it unless you wish to trap the use of it.

For an example of what it does have a look at /std/living/force.c

Simplest version would be :

force_me_to_do(string str) { command(str); }

But you may want to check the string and make sure it is a reasonable command
for you to do.  People should never be able to force a monster to do something
it shouldn't.  Especially forcing!
