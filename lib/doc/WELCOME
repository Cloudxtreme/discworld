                          Discworld
              Where all your dreams can't come true.

                         Wombles are:
                       Pinkfish   Ember
                       Drgoon   Furball
                       Signe        Bil

Please imagine a very nice picture of four Elephants sitting on a turtle's
(sex unknown) back flying through space.  On top of the elephants rests the
Disc of the world, garlanded by the long waterfall at its vast circumference
and domed by the baby blue vault of heaven.  Imagine this, because there is
not enough room here to draw it.

Based on the Discworld books by Terry Pratchett, please do not choose a
name of one of the characters from these books.
