Description
.SP 5 5
This command will prompt you for your old password then assuming you get it
right will let you enter your new password.  It will then ask you to type it
again to make sure you got it right the first time.  It then forces you to
save so your new password is immediately stored.  Try to choose sensible
passwords.  Try to choose words not in dictionaries, words with non-standard
characters like numbers or punctuation, try to use upper and lower case letters
or join different words together.  Don't use words that will be easily guessed
like friends names, or the macros on your function keys like cast spell. If
someone guesses your password they can take your character and destroy it by
getting it killed, leaving guilds, spending your exp etc.
