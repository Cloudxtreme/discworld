Description
.SP 5 5
Room aliases are used for aliasing exit directions to other names.
For example, if you have an exit which works on enter dust bin...
You could add an alias of "bin" to "dust bin" so that enter bin
would work too.  You could also alias "enter" to "dig", then "dig bin"
or "dig dust bin" would get you through the exit as well.  These aliases
are not used for items any more.  This was an old method of doing this
and is now obsolete.
