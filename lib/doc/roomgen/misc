The miscellaneous menu contains all the setup functions that many rooms need.
A brief description of each of them follows.

short - The description you get when in brief mode.  Usually about 1-4 words.
        Stairway, Path in Forest, Wide Open Plain, Mages Workroom.

long - The description you get when you are in verbose mode or when you type
       look.  It should be about 2-3 lines and contain a brief description of
       where the exits lead and what items are in the room.  The items should
       also be added in the items menu for the player to be able to look at.

light - The light level of the room.  This is used for working out if you can
        see or not.

zone - The zone is used for wandering monsters.  The monsters will wander
       around a set of zones.  If your room is of zone "ankh morpork", any
       monster that has been told to wander in that zone will just walk around
       the rooms there.

coord - You don't need to set the coordinates except in rooms where players are
        likely to be moved to and there is no exit leading back.  Rooms are
        supposed to work out their own coordinates based on those around them.
