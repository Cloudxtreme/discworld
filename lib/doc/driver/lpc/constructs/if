* The if else statement:

LPC's if statement is identical to that provided by C.  Syntax is as follows:

if (expression)
	statement;

Alternately:

if (expression) {
	statements;
}

Alternately:

if (expression0) {
	statements;
} else {
	statements1;
}

Alternately:

if (expression0) {
	statements0;
} else if (expression1) {
	statements1;
}

The number of else clauses is not explicitly limited.
