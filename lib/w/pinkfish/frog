Dear mr creator, Pinkfish, Sir

It is true that i am not a disc world II wizard, but i am an Asylum Wizard
under the name of Merlinn. 

I have only just made wizard there and found out about this place, and that it was just in its infancy, so i decided to see what i could do about making areas
here aswell...

I am quite creative, as you would see if you were on Asylum. I am a great fan
of Terry Pratchet, and think that i can offer alot to this Mud. 

At present i am working on my second novel. the first of which is currently being read by my publishers. It is of course medievil in theme, but more along
the lines of the dark and mysterious dark ages....but that will not, and has not detered my imagination from commming up with some good ideas for this mud.

I am thinking about the great tower that coin built from the unseen university.
and an area called holy wood...(i just finished reading that one)

Hopefully you will allow me to be wiz here, i have alot to offer...

...oh...i did die...and have lost my wiz powers....

                    with thanks...
                                Merlin,.
