Hi Pinky 
        Its me again, was only away for 20 mins lecture was really short.  Miss you pity you are not here, glad that you got some sleep though, 
you will make yourself ill.  
Hmmm a time for a phonecall will have to think about that for a while, a few factors to be taken into consideration (how many greens wombles i can get into a phone box) like the time difference, also i will have to ring from a phone box as it wouldnt look
good on the house phone bill and i need a phone box where it is quite, (ie. one where there is'nt 18 million buses going by) so i will have to ring you from church. the call box there is over in the old kitchen and is very quite.So i will have to ring you
on a day wheni am in church, due to the +8 time difference hmm im not sure when would be most appropiate, tell you what you pick a suitable time on Sunday I am in church from 10 am to 1.45 pm and back again at 3.00 pm until about 10.00pm so some time 
during that day may be most suitable.
 Yikes just went idle for twenty minutes, i was talking to the guy beside me about sci fiction books, another wacky computer scientist,
Well enough of that, i have an essay to write tonight, my oh my what a wonderful day
Say as for drudge work the labs are a bit like that, can be very boring, like today we had to sample every half an hour and we couldnt leave ,I'm afraid watching bugs grow is not even as interesting as watching paiint 
dry at least you can see paint!
I'm getting married sometime on a mud
Ding dong the bells are going to chime,
hmmm strange song for a musical not bother to finish it though it contains silly lines like
Feather and tar me , call out the army but get me to the church on time
Have to admit the idea of being feathered and tarred doesn't appeal to me though
Sisters and Brothers,  hmmmm I also have only one sister, dont talk about her much because there is not much to say really, dont see her unless shes at church we never really got on that well, she has never really done much, she has no qualifications, 
no job and is five months pregnant, when somthing nice happens ill probally talk about her more, like when she moves into the flat , or when the baby is born.
I warned Marty that if he sent you awful pictures of me i would send you some of him, but he likes looking silly. So didnt have much effect.
I loved the letter, i like recieving mail, mum was very curious, asked when i was going to Austrailia, have to admit ive been thinking about it
I finish this year of Uni at the start of June I am then off until October.
If I was to work all summer until September i would be able to afford a holiday, few problems though, I want to move out of the house next year so that i can be closer to Uni, also I auditioned last year to tour with a group of Christian musicians, 
The Contentals, they didnt write back last year, which i was really sad about they contacted me after the summer tour and told me i had been acepted and that they had forgotten to tell me! So i missed a tour To Russia, they rang in the winter but i was at
Uni then and couldn't go, the whole point of this speel is that they have asked me to go on this years summer tour which is to Scandinavia and then to Denver, as this is a Christian thing i wont be paid and will have to pay for the planes to these places
which would cost me about 
1300 pounds eek which i dont have and would need sponsership, this would mean that i could never afford any thing ever again.
Dont know what i will do though, my dad wants me to go to Holland and work there for the summer with a friend and then to go on a Holiday with the money I earn, its much cheaper to go to places from mainland Europe,so i am totally confused and dont know 
what i am going to do in the summer.
But i have exams to get through first I'll worry about it another time
hmmm its getting late i have to be home soon, Tuesday is the only day that i have to be home for a certain time in the evening, its also the day when people try to contact me because they know that i am in the house
This hasnt really been a very silly letter,
Maybe i should change that ,dont know why i have become so serious , must be something to do with being locked up in a lab all day, although that should make me crazy, bil has just arrived so i may have to leave the mail, pity that
kiss Pinkfish
hug Pinkfish
hopefully i will get time to see you tomorrow
actually unless something goes wrong i will see you tomorrow(if you come that is)
Dance to your daddy, my bonnie laddie
Dance to your daddy, when the boat comes in1
And you'll get a fishy in a little dishy
And you'll get a fishy when the boat comes in!
Question for you do you eat fish? (hopefully you dont eat frogs or wombles)
Are you really only 6 foot tall, you look much taller in the picture, in the pictures which i will hopefully soon have for you I may look tall because i am thin but im only 5 foot 1 (sob)
maybe someday Ill grow up big and tall,(maybe pigs will start flying, maybe wombles will stop collecting rubbish, maybe pinkfish wii become a greenfish, maybe the moon will be made of cream cheese and chives, maybe i should stop rambling and go home)
And now the end is near, and so I will leave hmmm
