the newsgroup alt.fan.pratchett.  There is biographical information
about Terry Pratchett, a list of his books and their ISBN numbers, as
well as information about his books, his collaborators and other fun
stuff.

Where possible, pointers to existing information (such as books,
magazine articles, and ftp sites) are included here, rather than
rehashing that information again.

If you haven't already done so, now is as good a time as any to read
the guide to Net etiquette which is posted to news.announce.newusers
regularly.  You should be familiar with acronyms like FAQ, FTP and
IMHO, as well as know about smileys, followups and when to reply by
email to postings.

1   Biographical Information

This section contains the biographical notes from his novels, some
notes about how he came to write, and short biographical notes about
Neil Gaiman and Josh Kirby.

----------------------------------------
1.1  Personal History

Terry Pratchett is an author of humourous fantasy-based
science-fiction novels.  He has been favourably compared to Douglas
Adams, P.G Wodehouse and Tom Sharpe.  A lot of people rather like his
books.

(This is stolen from his liner notes:)

	Terry Pratchett is, on average, a sort of youngish
	middle-aged.  He lives in Somerset with his wife and
	daughter, and long ago chose journalism as a career
	because it was indoor work with no heavy lifting.

	Beyond that he positively refuses to be drawn.  People
	never read these biographies anyway, do they?  They
	want to get on with the book, not wade through masses
	of prose designed to suggest that the author is really a
	very interesting person so look, okay, he wrote these
	other books, all right.  Most were also about the
	Discworld, and actually quite a lot of people liked
	them.

	He grows carnivorous plants as a hobby; they are a lot
	less interesting than people believe.

		* * *

	For those people who really need to know, Terry Pratchett
	was born in Buckinghamshire in 1948.  He's managed to avoid
	all the really interesting jobs authors take in order to
	look good in this sort of biography.  In his search for a
	quiet life he got a job as a Press officer with the Central
	Electricity Generating Board just after Three Mile Island,
	which shows his unerring sense of timing.  He now writes
	full time.  It's true about the carnivorous plants, though.

(and this one is stolen from Guards! Guards!:)

	Terry Pratchett was born in 1948 and is still not dead. He
	started work as a journalist one day in 1965 and saw his first 
	corpse three hours later, work experience _meaning_ something
	in those days.  After doing just about every job it's possible
	to do in provincial journalism, except of course covering 
	Saturday afternoon football, he joined the Central Electricity 
	Generating Board and became press officier for four nuclear
	power stations.  He'd write a book about his experiences if he
	thought anyone would believe it.

 	All this came to an end in 1987 when it became obvious that the
	Discworld series was much more enjoyable than real work.  Since 
	then the books have reached double figures and have a regular
	place in the bestseller lists.  He's also written three books 
	for children (the _Truckers_ trilogy).  Occasionally he gets
	accused of literature.

	Terry Pratchett lives in Somerset with his wife Lyn and daughter
	Rhianna.  He says writing is the most fun anyone can have by
	themselves.

The Carpet People adds:
	[TP lives in Somerset] where he grows carnivorous plants and
	tries to make computers do things they were never intended to
	do.

Only You Can Save Mankind:
	[TP lives in Somerset], and says he writes for anyone old
	enough to understand.

Lords and Ladies:
	He also grows carnivorous plants and thinks the world could
	use more orang-utans.

----------------------------------------
1.2  How He came to write

He started writing short stories, several of which were published.
His first, "The Hades Business", which was published in Science
Fantasy #60 (vol 20, 1963) was the first story he ever wrote.  He got
10/10 for it (the first time he had gotten 10/10 for anything except
for a painting which his teacher had *thought* were two dinosaurs
fighting) and it was published in the school magazine.

There it would have ended, except for his school headmaster who
addressed an assembly shortly afterward and announced that he didn't
approve of the "moral tone" of the story.  Well, the magazine, which
would have struggled to break even, sold out within 15 minutes.  He
learned an important lesson, right then - by writing it is possible to
infuriate your enemies as well as please your friends.

He then had the story typed up by his Aunt and sold it to Science
Fantasy, and with the profits bought a typewriter.  This his first act
as an income-earner was to fire his Aunt.  His mother rewarded this
Thatcherite attitude and paid for his typing lessons and he was on his
way.

----------------------------------------
1.3  Neil Gaiman

Neil Gaiman is an sf author whose credits include:
 * the _Sandman Comics_ (monthly, 3 collections so far:
   - Preludes and Nocturnes [1 85286 326 9],
   - The Dolls House [0 930289 59 5] and
   - Dream Country [1 56389 016]),
 * _Black_Orchid_ (a one-off comic in 3 parts, also now collected in a
   single graphic novel [1 85286 336 6] published by Titan Books),
 * _Violent_Cases_ [1 85286 372 2] published by Titan Books,
 * _Signal_to_Noise_ [0 575 05284 8] published by VG Graphics.  This
   was originally serialised in _The_Face_ magazine.
 * _The Books of Magic_ (no apparent ISBN), separate books I to IV,
   illustrated by various artists, printed by DC Comics.
 * _Temps_ (a collection of superhero short stories which claims to be
   "Devised by Neil Gaiman and Alex Stewart" [0 14 014560 5]),
 * _Ghastly Beyond Belief_ (an anthology of truly awful SF)
   [0-09-936830-7],
 * and _Don't Panic: The Official Companion to The Hitch-Hiker's Guide
   To The Galaxy_ [1 85286 0138 8].

----------------------------------------
1.4  Josh Kirby

Josh Kirby is an artist who has been drawing covers for many years
now.  He has done the covers for (among others) Terry Pratchett, Craig
Shaw Gardner, Esther Friesner, Dan McGirt and the new editions of Tom
Holt's novels.

He also illustrated the Discworld (sort-of picture) book "Eric".  He
has at least two poster books out, one with large versions of the
first seven Discworld covers.  One is "In the Garden of Unearthly
Delights", published by Paper Tiger in 1991.  It's ISBN is
1-85028-154-8.  It costs #9.95 (pounds sterling) and runs to 143 pages
of artwork.  The other is "The Josh Kirby Poster Book" (they obviously
paid large sums to an advertising agency for that title) published by
Corgi in 1991. [ISBN?]

----------------------------------------
2   Eccentricities of Books

Terry's books are available to varying degrees in the different
countries around the world.  Enclosed here is some information on
which books were released where, as well as some addresses for stores
that are reliable.

----------------------------------------
2.1  Eric

Eric wasn't released in the US, because Roc were uneasy about the big
edition and didn't buy it; people are talking to them now about the
mass market version.  (source, Terry Pratchett post on 8 Aug 1992).

----------------------------------------
2.2  UK Bookstores

Andromeda Books,
84 Suffolk Street,
Birmingham,
BA1 1TA,
UK

Forbidden Planet,
11 (I think, but what the hell, it'll find them) New Oxford Street,
London

----------------------------------------
2.3  US Bookstores

[?]
----------------------------------------
2.4  Translations

[?]

----------------------------------------
2.5  Covers and the absence of Kirby

Later US editions don't have Kirby covers.  Apparently the Kirby
covers make for confusion with Craig Shaw's Gardner's "humourous"
fantasy (which isn't at all in Terry's league).  This is only true of
Sourcery and later books.  The Colour of Magic through Mort had the
same Kirby covers as the UK editions.

----------------------------------------
3   Computers and TP

Terry is not only interested in computers, but is also on the net.

----------------------------------------
3.1  His E-Mail address

His e-mail address is tpratchett@cix.compulink.co.uk.  He warns that
"people who email me direct will get terse answers to the 'Hey, you're
not really TP, are you?' type questions, which still seem to be
turning up -- and I also tend to get a bit brief when its questions
that get regularly aired in the conference.  Apart from that, I'm a
real polite correspondent -- if I have time ...".

----------------------------------------
3.2  His Setup

He owns the fastest 486 he could buy, he writes with WordPerfect 4.2
and uses a laptop when travelling.  He doesn't like windows or mice.

He also used to own an Amstrad, and is a fan of the classic isometric
perspective games, _Batman_ and _Head Over Heels_.

----------------------------------------
3.3  "The Colour of Magic" Game

There was a game called "The Colour of Magic" released by Delta 4,
which contained passages straight from the book.  It was available for
8-bit machines, the Spectrum and C64.  It was produced by the company
behind _Bored of the Rings_, _Robin of Sherlock_ and _The Boggit_,
using the Quill adventure creator.  It even had a picture of Death
when you died, wearing a "Have a nice day" badge.

----------------------------------------
4   Merchandising

There are a lot of informal efforts at merchandising around, but no
really commercial ones.  This section explains why.

----------------------------------------
4.1  The Royal Position

         "'Everything works if people are sensible': It's all down to
          who's doin what, for whom, and what might loosely be called
          the spirit of the whole thing.  Fans doing things for other
          fans, such as Octarine does in the UK, (t-shirts and stuff
          for cost+) -- that's fine.  And I've let people do more
          than that to raise funds for a con.  I'd only get twitchy
          if it looked as though we were in real merchandising
          territory -- four-colour sweatshirts in Forbidden Planet,
          adverts in magazines ... and my concern there would be as
          much about fans getting value for money as anything else."

----------------------------------------
4.2  Discworld Models

Thanks to gds@ukc.ac.uk (G.D.Staines) for this:

Discworld characters - everyone from Death to Great A'Tuin himself (or
herself) - step (or crawl) out of the page in a new range of models by
  Clarecraft Designs,
  Woolpit,
  Bury St. Edmunds,
  Suffolk IP30 9SH. 

Tel:+44 359 41277 for a list of stockists or further information.

----------------------------------------
4.3  Octarine

Terry has this to say:
  The officially unofficial Not-the-Terry-Pratchett-Fan-Club.  The guy
to write to is Chris Tregenza, 14 Runswick Drive, Wollaton,
Nottingham, NG8 1JN.  It's like this: a couple of years ago they
approached me, and I said I thought it would be an amazingly bad idea
(I mean, what do you do after issue three of the magazine: 'Um.  He's
done another book.  It's great/okay/ not as good as the last one IMHO.
Um.  Is he losing more hair, or what?'  So I suggested they broaden
the base to include humourous sf/fantasy generally.  And it seems to
have worked.  They resemble ZZ9 a lot and there's an overlap of
members; I'd say it's probably more an organisation that people who
like the DW books might enjoy belonging to rather than a fan club).  I
go along to their birthday meetings (to merry cries of "Who's he?",
"Throw him out!" and so on).  But there's no learned articles on the
DW, no signed photos of The Master, no 'official news' ... and that's
fine by me.

----------------------------------------
4.4  Discworld Maps

A map of A-M is being prepared for the Discworld Companion.  The guy
doing it had to pinpoint the Assassins' Guild, for example, from
references in six different books.  Worked, too.  (Don't ask when it's
coming out -- one day ...).  Did you know there are no fewer than
eight eating/drinking places mentioned in A-M?  TP didn't.

More information - the guy doing it is Steven Briggs (the chap who is
also adapting books for theatre) and it will probably, weighing one
thing with another, in the balance of circumstance, given full
reservation and understanding that the world is an uncertain place, be
out in late '93.

----------------------------------------
4.5  Truckers Video

There is a video of _Truckers_ available.  The details are:
  Thames Television International, Video Collection International
  VHS TV 8159, 110 minutes, VHS-PAL, price: approx. 8 pounds.

----------------------------------------
4.6  Computer Games

See section 3.3.  The company went out of business, so currently there
are no Discworld computer games.

Terry wants you to seek his OK before you write Discworld MUDs.  His
e-mail address is in section 3.1

----------------------------------------
4.7  The Mort Film

A production company was put together and there was US and
Scandinavian and European involvement, and I wrote a couple of script
drafts which wet down well and everything was looking fine and then
the US people said "Hey, we've been doing market research in Power
Cable, Nebraska, and other centes of culture, and the Death/skeleton
bit doesn't work for us, it's a bit of a downer, we have a prarm with
it, so lose the skeleton".  The rest of the consortium said, did you
read the script?  The Americans said: sure, we LOVE it, it's GREAT,
it's HIGH CONCEPT.  Just lose the Death angle, guys.

Whereupon, I'm happy to say, they were told to keep on with the
medication and come back in a hundred years.

Currently, since the amount of money available for making movies in
Europe is about sixpence, the consortium is looking for some more
intelligent Americans in the film business.  This may prove difficult.

It could have been worse.  I've heard what Good Omens was looking like
by the time Sovereign's option mercifully ran out -- set in America,
no Four Horsemen...oh god.
 (from Terry himself, 2 Nov 1992)

----------------------------------------
4.8  Plays

The Guards! Guards! play (early June next year):

Write to:
Stephen Briggs,
23 Elms Drive,
Old Marston,
Oxford OX3 ONN

... who is in the bemused state of taking tons of orders ALREADY.

In the wind also are another version of MORT and, aha, a musical based
on Wyrd Sisters.  There are also various tentative plans for DW
productions in Australia and California (GAG ME WITH A SPOON).  As
soon as things are firm, they'll get posted here and on CIX in the UK.
  (Terry himself, 29 Oct 1992)

MORT...the Play.

The three-thespian version of Mort was by the Flying Thing Theatre
Company of Liverpool and was on in that city earlier this year.  I've
just heard that they're well into planning a tour in SW England for
the first three months of '93.  They're worth seeing.  I laughed a lot
(even though they're partly mime artists).

As soon as I hear their finalised tour dates, I'll post them here and
on CIX.
  (Terry himself, 2 Nov 1992)

----------------------------------------
5   Related Files

Terry is a popular chappie.  Here are some other electronically
available documents which you might like to look at.
---------------------------------------- 
5.1  The Terry Pratchett Bibliography

Circulated by
	Nathan.Torkington@vuw.ac.nz
this contains ISBN numbers, titles and blurbs for all TP's books.
It should be available (soon) via FTP as
	ftp.uu.net:/pub/usenet/alt.fan.pratchett/pratchett-biblio-faq
This is posted around the first and fifteenth of every month to
	alt.fan.pratchett
and	new.answers

----------------------------------------
5.2  The Annotated Pratchett

Circulated by
	leo@ph.tn.tudelft.nl
(Leo Breebaart), this explains the subtleties of Terry's works.  It is
currently at v4.0 and is posted to alt.fan.pratchett every month.  It
can be retrieved via anonymous FTP as
	theory.lcs.mit.edu:pub/dmjones/annotated-pratchett
or
	potemkin.cs.pdx.edu:/pub/pratchett/annotated-pratchett

----------------------------------------
6  Miscellany

Here's some stuff that didn't fit into any other category.

----------------------------------------
6.1  Similar Authors

P.G. Wodehouse, Douglas Adams, Jerome K. Jerome, Robert Rankin, Tom
Sharpe, Tom Holt, Calvin Trillin, P.J O'Rourke and Dave Barry are some
people whose styles are similar.

----------------------------------------
6.2  Rincewind's Name

Terry himself pronounces it to rhyme with "Mince pinned" and in Eric,
Rincewind meets his ancestor whose translated name means "Washer of
Winds".  Evidence would then tend to point to this pronounciation.

----------------------------------------
6.3  More Rincewind

Terry has said that he will write another Rincewind novel.  When,
well, that's a different question :-)
[more?]

----------------------------------------
6.4  The Future

The next DW book will probably be a sequel to Guards! Guards!,
containing a slightly expanded City Watch (a troll and a dwarf now on
the strength as a result of affirmative action hiring procedures)
Captain Vimes' wedding day, and Carrot learning a thing or two....
The working title is "Men at Arms."

Terry also wants to expand into YA (Young Adult) books as well.  He
has "Johnny and the Dead" coming out around April 1993.

----------------------------------------
6.5  Inconsistencies

Well, he *is* fallible.  Known inconsistencies are:
 * the number of eyes that Greebo has in _Witches_Abroad_
 * in _TCOM_, All's Fallowe is the one night of the year when witches
   stay home in bed.  In _Wyrd_Sisters_ however, this occurs on
   Hogswatch night.
 * there are inconsistencies about smells: in _TLF_, Rincewind asks
   what a smell is, and Twoflower thinks that it is bacon.  Later on,
   however, Twoflower is described as having "no sense of smell".
   Rincewind, in _Sourcery_, is an Ankh-Morporkian who (like all
   Ankh-Morporkians) has no sense of smell.
 * there are lots of geographical inconsistencies, which caused TP to
   preface _Sourcery_ with "This book does not contain a map.  Please
   feel free to draw your own".  One of the major inconsistencies
   which few people spot is that given the size of the Disc, and the
   distance the sun would therefore need to travel around it in 24
   hours, and that light travels at the speed of sound in the high
   magical field, then the sun is actually orbiting the Disc at twice
   the speed of its own light.
 * When Rincewind meets Death in Ankh-Morpork, in _The_
   Colour_Of_Magic_, people walk through Death.  Whereas later on,
   people are described as avoiding him.
 * In TCOM, Death kills a fly.  The Death from Mort and later books
   would never do such a thing - it changes reality.

----------------------------------------
6.6  Appearances

Book signings:

None.  We cut his arms off so he wouldn't sign any more books and he'd
just get on with writing them.

Cons:

Swancon - Perth, Australia Easter 1993 (and MAYBE another swift few
days on the East coast like this year)
Finncon - Helsinki, August 93
Orycon - Portland, Oregon, November 1993

----------------------------------------
6.7  The Hedgehog Song

It would appear that there was a Hedgehog song around the '20s, if not
before, with the same refrain as the Discworld song.  However, Terry
says "since I doubt it ever could have been in print, I can bravely
plead parallel evolution at most. There is a certain, how shall I put
it, natural cadence to the words."

Blurb:
	Jerome K. Jerome meets _Lord of the Rings_ (with a
	touch of _Peter Pan_) ...
	On a world supported on the back of a giant turtle
	(sex unknown), a gleeful, explosive, wickedly
	eccentric expedition sets out.  There's an avaricious
	but inept wizard, a naive tourist whose luggage
	moves on hundreds of dear little legs, dragons who
	only exist if you believe in them, and of course THE
	EDGE of the planet ...
	The wackiest and most original fantasy since
	_Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy_.

ISBN	0 552 12848 1

Blurb:
	As it moves towards a seemingly inevitable collision
	with a malevolent red star, the Discworld has only one
	possible saviour.  Unfortunately, this happens to be
	the singularly inept and cowardly wizard called
	Rincewind, who was last seen falling off the edge of
	the world ....
	The funniest and most unorthodox fantasy in this or

Blurb:
	The last thing the wizard Drum Billet did, before Death
	laid a bony hand on his shoulder, was to pass on his
	staff of power to the eighth son of an eighth son.
	Unfortunately for his colleagues in the chauvinistic
	(not to say mysogynistic) world of magic, he failed to
	check on the new-born baby's sex ...
	A third hilarious adventure by the author of _The Colour

	did not fit Teppic for the task assigned to him by fate.
	He inherited the throne of the desert kingdom of

Blurb:
	This is where the dragons went.
	They lie ... not dead, not asleep, but ... dormant.  And
	although the space they occupy isn't like normal space,
	nevertheless they are packed in tightly.  They could put
	you in mind of a can of sardines, if you thought sardines
	were huge and scaly.  And presumably, somewhere, there's

Blurb:
	Eric is the Discworld's only demonology hacker.
	Pity he's not very good at it.
	All he wants is three wishes granted.  Nothing fancy - to
	be immortal, rule the world, have the most beautiful woman
	in the world fall madly in love with him, the usual stuff.
	But instead of a tractable demon, he calls up Rincewind,
	probably the most incompetent wizard in the universe, and
	the extremely *intractable* and hostile form of travel
	accessory known as the Luggage.
	With them on his side, Eric's in for a ride through space
	and time that is bound to make him wish (quite fervently)
	again - this time that he'd never been born.

%T Reaper Man
%I Corgi
%D
ISBN #	0 575 04979 0 (Hardback)
	0 552 13464 3 (Paperback)

Blurb:
	Death is missing - presumed ... er ... gone.
	Which leads to the kind of chaos to *always* expect when
	an important public service is withdrawn.
	Ghosts and poltergeists fill up the Discworld.  Dead
	Rights activist Reg Shoe - "You Don't Have to Take This
	Lying Down" - suddenly has more work than he had ever
	dreamed of.  And newly deceased wizard Windle Poons wakes
	up in his coffin to find that he has come back as a corpse.
	But it's up to Windle and the members of Ankh-Morpork's
	rather unfrightening group of undead (*) to save the world
	for the living.
	Meanwhile, on a little farm far, far away, a tall, dark
	stranger is turning out to be really good with a scythe.
	There's a harvest to be got in.  And a different battle to
	be fought.
	(*) Arthur Winkings, for example, became a vampire after
	being bitten by a lawyer.  Schleppel the bogeyman would be
	better at his job if he wasn't agoraphobic and frightened
	of coming out of the closet.  And Mr Ixolite is a banshee
	with a speech impediment, so instead of standing on the roof
	and screaming when there's a death in the house he writes
	"OooEeeOooEeeOoo" on a piece of paper and pushes it under
	the door.

Blurb:
	It seemed an easy job ...
	After all, how difficult could it be to make sure that a
	servant girl *doesn't* marry a prince?
	But for the witches Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and Magrat
	Garlick, travelling to the distant city of Genua, things are
	never that simple ...
	For one thing, all they've got is Mrs Gogol's voodoo, a
	one-eyed cat and a second-hand magic wand that can only do
	pumpkins.  And they're up against the malignant power of
	the Godmother herself, who has made Destiny an offer it can't
	refuse.  And finally there's the sheer power of the Story.
	Servant girls *have* to marry the Prince.  That's what life
	is all about.
	You can't fight a Happy Ending.
	At least - up until now ...

	Brutha is a simple lad.  He can't read.  He can't write.  He's

	He wants to overthrow a huge and corrupt church.
	He wants to prevent a horrible holy war.
	He wants to stop the persecution of a philosopher who has dared
	to suggest that, contrary to the Church's dogma, the Discworld
	really *does* go through space on the back of an enormous
	turtle (*).
	He wants peace and justice and brotherly love.  He wants the

	But most of all, what he really wants, more than anything else,

	aged four.  And Magrat Garlick, witch, is going to be married
	in the morning...  Everything ought to be going like a dream.
	But the Lancre All-Comers Morris Team have got drunk on a
	fairy mound and the elves have come back, bringing all those
	things *traditionally* associated with the magical, glittering
	realm of Faerie: cruelty, kidnapping, malice and evil, evil
	murder.[*] Granny Weatherwax and her tiny argumentative coven
	have *really* got their work cut out this time...  With full

	"In the beginning, there was nothing but endless flatness.
	Then came the Carpet..."

	That's the old story everyone knows and loves (even if they
	don't really *believe* it). For now the Carpet is home for
	many different tribes and peoples -- from the empire-building
	Dumii, to the nomadic Munrungs, the proud Deftmenes, and the
	terrible creatures from the Unswept Regions.  And now there's
	a new story in the making.

	The story of the time when Fray begins to move, sweeping a
	trail of destruction across the Carpet.

	The story of the power-hungry mouls, saddling up their snargs
	and riding to the attack.

	The story of Glurk and Snibril, Munrung brothers, who set out
	on an adventure to end all adventures when their village is

	The story that will come to a terrible end -- if someone

To date, Terry has only written two books with other authors - "Good

are explained for the benefit of the trans-Atlantic audience.

	Real cats never eat from bowls (at least not the ones marked

	Real cats do eat quiche.  And giblets.  And butter.  And anything

	mit Hilfe der Wahrscheinlichkeitsmathematik sowieso schon
	vorher, was hinterher wann und wie passiert - die Prophezeiung
	als strenge Wissenschaft sozusagen.

	Und trotz aller dieser Bequemlichkeiten macht sich Dom Salabos
	auf und reist durch Paralleluniversen und Multi-realitaeten,
	um eine legendaere Superrasse aufzustoebern.  Als er endlich
	die gesuchte Spezies findet, holt die Illusion der Realitaet
	die Wissenschaft der Prophezeiung ein. Nicht unbedingt zum
	Nachteil der Beteiligten.

	Fuer die Tausenden von winzigen Nomen, die unter dem Fussboden
	eines grossen Kaufhauses leben gibt es kein Draussen. Dinge
	wie Tag und Nacht, Sonne und Regen sind nur alte vergangene
	Legenden.

	Dann bringt eine verheerende Nachricht ihre Existenz zum
	Einsturz: das Kaufhaus - ihre ganze Welt - soll abgerissen
	werden. Und es bleibt Masklin, einem der letzten Nomen, die
	ins Kaufhaus kamen, ueberlassen, sich einen unglaublichen
	Fluchtplan auszudenken, der alle Nomen in die Gefahren des
	grossen Draussen bringt ...

	Irgendwo, an einem Platz so weit oben, dass es kein unten

	bringen - zurueck woher auch immer sie kamen.

	Und ein Nom, Masklin, weiss, dass sie versuchen muessen, mit
	diesem Schiff Verbindung aufzunehmen.

	Das beudeutet, nach Florida zu gehen (wo immer das ist) und
	dort den Start eines Kommunikationssatelliten (was immer das
	ist) zu erreichen.

	Ein laecherlicher Plan. Unmoeglich.

	Aber Masklin weiss das nicht, also versucht er es eben. Und

	neuen Art Lastwagen zu fahren, einem Lastwagen mit Fluegeln -

	Wenn Sie in die Zukunft sehen moechten, dann stellen Sie sich
	einen Jungen vor, der mit seinen Freunden und einem Hund
	unterwegs ist. Denken Sie an einen Sommer, der niemals endet.

	Wenn Sie in die Zukunft sehen moechten, so denken Sie an einen
	Schuh mit losen Schnuersenkeln. Einen Turnschuh, der nach
	kleinen Steinen tritt. Denken Sie an einen Stock: Man kann
	damit nach interessanten Dingen stochern oder ihn fortwerfen,
	vielleicht holt ihn der Hund zurueck, vielleicht auch
	nicht.  Denken Sie an ein leises, disharmonisches Pfeifen, das
	eine bekannte Melodie bis zur Unkenntlichkeit entstellt.
	Denken Sie an jemanden, der halb Engel, halb Teufel und ganz
	Mensch ist ...

	An einen Jungen, der hoffnungsvoll nach Tadfield latscht.

	Fuer immer ...
