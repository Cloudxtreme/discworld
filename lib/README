The discworld mudlib.

Created by Pinkfish, Lynscar, Furball, Ember, Godot, Bil.

This mudlib was originaly based on the borderline mudlib by Michael
O'reilly and Michael Malone.  (Pariah and Xavier) who now run a mud
called Distant mirrors.

How to set it up.  First you need to get the correct driver for the
mudlib.  This means you need to get the driver Mudos_xxx-w.tar.Z
Where xxx is the current version number.  Second, you need to edit
the files secure/master.c and secure/bastards.c to put yourself
into the relevant arrays there.

You should now be able to log into this mudlib as a high lord.  This
gives you access everywhere.  One of the first things you will probably
want to do is create a board...  The main one would probably be useful.

To do this
call create_board("frog") /obj/handlers/board_handler

Easy huh?  Ok, then clone /obj/misc/board_master and you have your
portable buliten board.

Docs are in /doc.  The most uptodate ones being in /doc/new.  help nroff
for help on all the weird . thingys in the files.

Share and enjoy,
Pinkfish.
