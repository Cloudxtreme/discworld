Name

mail - mailing other players.

Syntax
.SI 5
mail [name] [name] ...

Description
.SP 5 5
The mailer enables players to send and recieve mail to and from other
players.  The Post Office is located two south, five east, one northeast,
one east, one southeast and four south from the bar area of the Mended
Drum.  In this room you may "mail player" to send mail to a person, or simply
type "mail" to look at mail sent to you.
.EP

Sending mail
.SP 5 5
Once you have typed "mail person", you are prompted for a subject. 
Note that you can mail
more than one person in one go, by simply mentioning more names.
The subject is a one line summary of what the mail is about. 
If you leave it blank, you
leave the sending mail process. After this you are asked for Cc's, or
Carbon-Copy recipents. Enter anyone else who should recieve the mail, one
per line. Enter a blank line to stop. Then you can enter the body of the mail
itself. Entering "**" on a line by itself finishes mailing and gives you
a number of options. The four I most often use are S, Q, E and L. S saves
and posts the message. Q abandons it altogether, E invokes ed, the lovely
little editor everyone loves to hate, and L will display the mail message.
The rest you can play with sometime.

If you have an alias for ".signature", then, in a similar format to that
of .plan (see finger), it will be appended to your mail.
.EP

Reading mail
.SP 5 5
Typing "mail" by itself can have two effects. It will either inform you
that you have "No mail.", or it will list the headers of upto twenty of
your messages. It will display the headers of the twenty last messages,
unless you have more than twenty new ones, when it will display twenty
from the first new one. Next to one of the headers there will be a ">"
displayed. This is the pointer. To read a mail message, you may either
enter its' number, or pressing enter will display the one the pointer is
pointing too.

You get a number of other options at this point:
.EP
     h [range] - show headers.
     m <name>  - mails to the given person
     r [num]   - replys to the message number or the current message 
		 if none given
     R [num]   - as above but only sends to the sender, not the Cc's 
		 as well
     d [range] - deletes a range of messages
     f [num] <name> - forwards the message (current or given) to the 
		 person
     + [num]   - goes on num messages (1 default)
     - [num]   - goes back num messages (q default)
     l         - List the currently avaiable mailing lists.
     l <list>  - List the members of the mailing list <list>.
     q         - quit and delete all the messages selected for deletion
     x         - quit but do not delete all the messages
     ?         - display some info like this
     <num>     - reads messages num

Nicknames
.SP 5 5
The mailer can use nicknames, and as just more than nickname-to-name
replacement. The mailer will recognise nicknames when you "mail person",
"mail person1 person2", enter Cc's, forward mail, or "m person" at the
status prompt thingy.

With the "mail person person" format, it will expand the entire line as
a nickname first. You could use this for your own form of mailing lists.
Nicknames within these lists are also expanded.
