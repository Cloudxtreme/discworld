Description
.SP 5 5
When you are finished playing, this command will save you and you will then
leave the mud.  You will normally drop all your possesions so it is a good
idea to go and sell them first.  Some items on the mud will remain with you
over quits.  Quitting forces you to save so nothing will be lost and you do
not need to save before quitting.
