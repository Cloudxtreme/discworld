int set_heart_beat(int flag)
.SP 5 5
Enable or disable heart beat. If the heart beat is not needed for the moment,
then do disable it. This will reduce system over head.

Return true for success, and false for failure. Specifically, it will
fail if the heart beat function has been disabled, which it will be
if there is a run time error in it.
