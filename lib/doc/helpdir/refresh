Description
.SP 5 5
This command is one of the options you have when you have run out of
lives.  There are two versions of the command.  
Refresh me, will basicly start you over again.  You keep several things 
though.  Any abilities you happened to pick up (like emote or whatever).  
It resets all your stats, allows you to rearrange them again, resets your 
guild, your race and your skills.  Use this command with care.  It 
basicly restarts your character.
Refresh totally, will erase you character and recreate it.  It will be like 
you're loging in for the first time, ie no money, no equipment, no skills, 
no quests, no nothing.  Use with extra care.
