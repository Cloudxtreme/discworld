Ankh-Morpork is too big to show on a simple map, so go and buy a copy of
"The Alpha to Omega Map of Ankh-Morpork" in which most of the streets and
alleys have their own map showing connections with other roads and buildings
of interest.

Or you could invest in a copy of "The Streets of Ankh-Morpork" by Stephen
Briggs and Terry Pratchett and see the original.
