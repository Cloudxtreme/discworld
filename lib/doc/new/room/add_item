Description
.SP 5 5
This adds in an item description into the room.  This allows you to set
up objects which do not as such exist, but can be looked at for instance.
There should be a lot of these in rooms.  The name of the item can be
multiple word, and the plural for it is automagicaly added, unless the
no_plural flag is set.  If the name is an array all of the elements in
the array respond to the description.

If the desc is set to an array, you can use this for handling things like
read messages and so on too.  Every second element in the array is the
description/text to be printed and the other element is the command
upon which the text should be printed.  The special command 'long' is
used to set the long description.

Since this is a long description, you can use process_string embeded
commands in the description.
