Exits are used to allow a player to move from one room to another.  They have
3 components.  The direction, the destination and the type.  The type is just
a set of predefined constants.  It is possible to set up exits using about 5
variables, but all common ones are defined for you.  The exit direction is just
the command the player types to go in a direction, and the destination is the
name of the room to which the exit leads.
