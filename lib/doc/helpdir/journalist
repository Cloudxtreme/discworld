The Noble Art of Journalism
(or how to become a flunky for the AM Daily)

  Here at the great and prestigious *cough* AM Daily, we are always looking
for new recruits to write for the paper.  Why, you may ask?  Well, don't you
get sick of reading drivel written by me (Obilix)?  Hell, I know I do.  Also,
contrary to popular belief, I am not _quite_ all-seeing and all-knowing -
it is good to get different perspectives on our beloved DiscWorld, especially
from you, the players.

So, other than the satisfaction of seeing your name in print, what do you get
from putting in all this effort?

Well, after I receive your first story, you'll get your very own AM Daily
journalist's badge, that you can whip out and use to annoy everyone around
you on a regular basis.

After I get around 3 stories, mail me with a description of your office and
all of the items in it, and I'll try to find some time to code it for you.
Impress your friends, make your enemies jealous ... have your own
private room to do whatever you like in. *ahem*

But wait, there's more!

On top of these great rewards, you also get paid per story ...

$10 for a small story
$20 for a medium sized story
$40 for a large story

Of course, I reserve the right to edit stories for whatever reason, but in
reality I don't tend to do so very much ... after all, they are your stories...

Because I get ripped-off ... err ... charged for email, I won't put my
address on here, but just ask me if you like.

And that's about it!

If I've managed to convince you to become a journo, mail me on the mud, or
grab me when I'm on (which is most of my life, it seems ... ), and we'll go
from there.

Cheers,
Obilix, Editor of the AM Daily.
