set_author - set the author associated with an object.

Synopsis
.SI 5
void set_author (string author);

Description
.SP 5 5

Every object has both an author and a domain associated with it for
the purposes of tracking statistics for authors and domains.  Domains
may only be set in the master object function domain_file(4), however
authors are different.  They can be initialized to some default value
by author_file(4) in the master object, but can also be changed using
the set_author efun.

set_author changes the author of the object that it is called within.
That author will get credit for all future actions of that object that
affect mudlib statistics.  Note that this may cause some weird numbers
to occur in the categories "objects" and "array_size", since the
object may have initialized arrays or been created under the original
author's credit, but it could be destructed or free the arrays that
it's using under another author, thus reducing numbers from a count
that didn't have those same numbers added previously.  To rememdy
this, only use set_author within create(4), and use it before any
arrays are allocated if at all possible.
