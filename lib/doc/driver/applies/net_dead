Description
.SP 5 5

If an interactive object (i.e. the player object) suddenly loses its
connection (i.e. it goes "net dead"), then the driver calls this
function on that object giving it a chance to clean up, notify its
environment etc.  Be aware that functions that depend on the object
being interactive will not work as expected.
