Description
.SP 5 5
You are able to configure your character once.  You will be allowed once during
your characters life to modify the stats that you start with.  Stats take the
range of 8 -> 18/00 normally.  You can make your stats what you want them to be
by typing rearrange and following the instructions.  The idea of this command
is to make your character what you want it to be.  You should also read the
help on stats to find out what each of them does.  Don't play with this until
you have decided what you want your character to be like.
