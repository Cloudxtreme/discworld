   At this moment player killing is an option open to all players.
   To be allowed to kill players you have to register yourself at the
patricians office.  Registering yourself leaves you open to attack from other, registered
players.  Only players with the tag KILLER on the 'who' list can be attacked
or attack any other player similarly tagged.
This is not the only way to register.  Un-licensed thieving, which is stealing
by any player not in the thieves guild will automatically register you.
  Once you have decided to be a player killer, there is no turning back.
This system may change in the future, and updates will be put here.
