Description
.SP 5 5
The driver calls epilog() in master after the master object has been loaded.
Mudlibs typically use epilog to initialize data structures in master (such
as security tables etc).  epiolog() should returns an array of filenames
which correspond to objects that the mudlib wants to have preloaded; that is,
loaded before the first player logs in.  For each filename returned in the
array, the driver will called preload(filename) in master.
