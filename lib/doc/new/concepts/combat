Description
.SP 5 5
Combat is controlled on both the player object and the monster objects
by the function attack().  Each call to the attack function does
an attack.  The attack function also checks all of the object in its
attackers_list to see if they are in the room it is in.  If they are
not it puts them in another array and starts up a call_out.  It
then checks to see if the person is wielding a weapon.  If they are
it uses that for the damage, else it uses the player object itself.

This function also checks the attacking object to see if it is being
protected, if it is, it redirects the attacks.  The attacking object
is selected randomly from the attacker_list unless the concentrate
pramater is set using set_concentrate().  If this is set then the
monster will only attack the first thing in its attacker_list.
(Well until it dies anyway).

The function attack_by(this_object()) is called on the object we are
attacking.  The function attack_by(ob) puts the object into the
attackers_array on the object it is called on.  The function attack_ob(ob)
puts the attacker in the attackers_array as well.  In fact both of these
functions do very similar things.

Once all of these things are done, the actuall attack is called on the
weapon.  This is done by calling the function weapon_attack(attackee,
attacker) is called on the weapon, or on the object itself.  If the
flag, always use natural attacks is set, then the default natural attacks
will also be used even if the object is wielding a weapon. (set_natural()).

The weapon itself calculates the damage by calling the function query_ac()
on the object being attacked with the attack type.  (ie "sharp" or "blunt").
This is then subtracted from the value "to hit" that is gained from the
attack, if the value is greater than 0 then the attack is said to have
"hit".  If it hits then a second "damage" value is calculated and this
also has the armour class subtracted off it, this is the actual damage
done to the creature.  The weapon_attack function also returns the
amount of xp to add onto the attacking creature.

A more detailed explanation of weapon attacks.  A weapon attack consists
of three parts.  A "base", a "to hit" and a "damage" part.  The way that
hits and damage is calculated is like this.
.EP
.SI 5

hit_value = base + to_hit

if (hit_value > 0) then
  damage = base + damage
/* The way this is actualy done is
  damage = hit_value - to_hit + damage
 */
endif

As all this is calculated, weapons and armours are also damaged.  If
an armour protects against an attack it has a chance (equal to the
damage_change variable) of being damaged.  The amount of damage done
is equal to the amount of damage done by the weapon.  The same follows
on the weapons.
