set_hold - Allows people to set what they are holding.

Syntax
.SI 5
int *set_hold(object ob, int start_limb);
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
This function sets the object to be held in the start_limb and any
other limbs around it depending on how many it needs.  It returns an
array containing the ids of each of the limbs which it has set itself
into.  These can be used as indexes into the limbs array to get the names.

If -1 is specified as the limb, then it will try and find the first
limb that does not have anything in it and hold itself in that.

The function query_no_limbs is called on the object being held to find
out how many limbs it uses up.
