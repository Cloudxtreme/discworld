Races

On Discworld live a wide variety of different races.  To add to the flavour of
the game, you can play a number of these races.  Different races will give you
different attributes.  Some races can see in very low light.  Other races will
be endowed with good strength and constition.  Some races are naturally more
intelligent and others of course, better endowed for a fighters life.

Changing race is a magical process so it is reversible.  However the effects of
changing your race will take a terrible toll on your body.  You will probably
forget things resulting in skill losses.  You may well lose stats and other
things.  Changing your race is not something to be done lightly.
