You can set the percentage of your hit points at which you run away.  If
you have set the number to zero (default) you are in brave mode and wont
run away even if you are almost dead (in fact even if you are dead).
Warning however, the experience points you recieve for doing damage to a
monster will be lower the higher your wimpy.  If you set your wimpy to
100% you will loose 100% of your xp.  Bing!
