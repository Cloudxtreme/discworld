Description
.SP 5 5

If process_input is present in the player object, then the MudOS driver
parser will send it a copy of each line the player types.  Process_input
makes it easy to implement features like command history and protection
against wizcuffs.  process_input can also modify the player input before it
is parsed.  If process_input returns a non-zero string, that string is
used by the driver instead of what the player typed.
