Synopsis
.SI 5
varargs void say(string str, object obj);

Send a message `str' to all players in the same object (room).

The second argument is optional.  If second argument `obj' specified,
the message is sent to all except `obj'.  If `obj' is not an object, but
an array of objects, all those objects are excluded from receiving the
message.

This command behaves differently if called from a "heart_beat()".
When called from a "heart_beat()", the message will reach all players in
the same environment of the object that calls "say()".
