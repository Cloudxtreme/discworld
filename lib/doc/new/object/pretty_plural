.SP 5 5
This is used by the inventory printing routines of containers and rooms.  It
was specifical written to handle money that needed to be displayed over
several lines but only be one object.  The way this was achived was if
pretty_plural returns an array then each of the elements of the array is
considered to be a seperate object and displayed accordingly.
