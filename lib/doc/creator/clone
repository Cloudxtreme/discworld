Clone is used to get a usable copy of an object on disk.  This is how all
objects used in the game are created, except the rare one off objects that
do not actually move into the game usually.  You must specify the file name
of the objects you wish to clone.
If an obvar assignment is made then the obvar specified will point to the
newly created object.
