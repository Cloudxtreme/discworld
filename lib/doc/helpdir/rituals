Description
.SP 5 5
This command shows what rituals you know.  The use of a certain ritual is
granted to a person by a god - automatically to a priest of that god,
while non-priest worshippers must undertake certain tasks to earn the
god's respect.  NB: in dying, your mind loses its connection to your god,
so you will forget the rituals you know if you die and need to be
retaught them after being resurrected.
