Welcome to Discworld: the stuff of which dreams are made.

Silently, slowly and surely, Great A'Tuin paddles through space, its
great eyes surveying the dark, empty wastes before and behind it.  Standing
on A'Tuin's great back are four enormous elephants, straining under the
colossal weight of the Discworld itself.  It sparkles with magic, reflects
the light of the stars and generally fails to be as unobtrusive as
possible.

Welcome.
