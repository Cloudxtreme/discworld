Description
.SP 5 5
This command shows what spells you know.  Spells are manipulations of
magic used by wizards and witches.  They can be obtained from books of
lore and ancient scrolls, or taught from one magic user to another.  NB:
in dying, the magic of spells is released from the mind, so you
will forget the spells you know if you die and need to relearn them
after being resurrected.
