Description
.SP 5 5
This efun is only available when DEBUGMALLOC and DEBUGMALLOC_EXTENSIONS are
both defined in options.h at driver build time.  The debugmalloc() efun will
dump information on those chunks of memory allocated by DMALLOC() and related
macros if the mask bitwise and'd (&) with the tag supplied by the macro
(i.e. (mask & tag)) is non-zero.  Read md.c and config.h in the driver source
for more information.
