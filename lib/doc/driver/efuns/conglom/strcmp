Description
.SP 5 5
This implementatin of strcmp() is identical to the one found in C libraries.
If string one lexically precedes string two, then strcmp() returns a number
less than 0.  If the two strings have the same value, strcmp() returns 0.
If string two lexically precedes string one, then strcmp() returns a number
greater than 0.  This efunction is particularly useful in the compare
functions needed by sort_array(3).
