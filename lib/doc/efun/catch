mixed catch(string expr)

.SP 5 5
Evaluate expr. If there is no error, 0 is returned. If there is a standard
error, a string (with a leading '*') will be returned.

The function throw(value) can be used to immediately return any value,
except 0.

The catch() is somewhat costly, and should not be used just anywhere. Rather
it should be used at places where an error would destroy consistency.
