Ankh-Morpork, jewel* of cities, nestles in the heart of the Sto Plains a
number of miles upstream from the estuary on the River Ankh.  It is actually
two cities, proud Ankh and pestilential Morpork, connected by many bridges,
the most famous of which is the Brass Bridge**.  Ankh-Morpork houses the
headquarters of most, though not all, of the Discworld guilds, and is the
centre of commerce for the Sto Plains and the Circle Sea, attracting
merchants from far and wide.  Not surprisingly, therefore, as a seeker of
adventure, you have found yourself at this great city*** and no doubt you
will find yourself here again many more times in your quest for fame and
fortune.

* Okay, so it's a carbuncle.
** With eight heraldic hippopotami facing seaward; according to legend,
        should danger ever threaten the city, they will run away.
*** There's a saying that all roads lead to Ankh-Morpork.  And it's wrong.
        All roads lead away from Ankh-Morpork, but sometimes people just
        walk along them the wrong way.
