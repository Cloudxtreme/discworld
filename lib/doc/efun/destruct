void destruct(object ob)

.SP 5 5
Completely destroy and remove object ob. The argument can also be a string. 
After the call to destruct(), no global variables will exist any longer,
only local, and arguments.

If an object self-destructs, it will immediately terminate execution and
return 0. There is one exception: If the destruct-statement is followed by
a return 1; immediately after, then this return statement will be executed.

This should NOT be used on normal objects in the game, instead use the lfun
dest_me() in the object you want removed: ob->dest_me();. This will ensure 
correct update of weights, volumes etc.

One of the times you will need to call this is in the dest_me function
(assuming you have not inherited a standard thingy and need to write
it yourself).  Or in shadows.
