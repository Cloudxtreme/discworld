Description
.SP 5 5
The throw() efun may be used to force an error to occur in an object.  When
used in conjunction, throw() and catch() allow the programmer to choose what
error message is displayed when a runtime error occurs.  When throw() is used,
it should be used in conjunction with the catch(3) efun.  Here is a typical
usage:

   string err;
   int rc;

   err = catch(rc = ob->move(dest));
   if (err) {
        throw("move.c: ob->move(dest): " + err + "\n");
        return;
   }
