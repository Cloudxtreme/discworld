set_race - Sets the name of the race.

Syntax
.SI 5
void set_race(string race);
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
Sets the name of the race.  The name is used to look up the race
object on the /std/race.c object when set_level is called.  The race
name does not have to exist on this object however, it can be anything
and will default to the standard race object in this case.  If you want
specialised bits or things for your race.  Create a race object modeled
off the ones in /std/races and ask one of the nice friendly high lords
to install it for you.  There will (should) be a document on races
and how to create them.  Real soon now.
