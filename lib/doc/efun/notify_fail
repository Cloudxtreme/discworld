void notify_fail(string str)
.SP 5 5
Set the message that will be printed if the functions for the current
verb return 0. Default is 'What?'.

If notify_fail() is called more than once, only the last call of
will be used.

The idea of this function is to give better error messages instead of simply
What ?.  Use this function as much as you can.  It is a lot more polite to
return an error from your add_actioned commands than to prtint and error
and return 1.
