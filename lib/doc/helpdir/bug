Description

This command informs the creators of an object that a bug is present on it.
The error message is recorded in one central log file and a log file specific
to the room you are standing in.  For this reason, if you have a bug on an
object try to do a bug report near the place you got it as that is most likely
going to be owned by the same people as wrote the object.
