Syntax
.SI 5
void set_short(string str);
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
The short description is the description seen in peoples inventorys and
in brief mode when you enter rooms.  This should be only a few words long
and should contain a fairly good description of the object.  Colour
processing is done on basicly all of discworlds output, so that will
work in the short.  However...  process_string won't be done all over
the place.  So be careful if you put this in the short description
as it probably will not work as you want.
