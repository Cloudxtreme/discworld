 
set_enchant             Discworld object help                   set_enchant

Name
     set_enchant - defines the 'quantity' of enchantment on an object.

Syntax
     int set_enchant(int amt);

Description
     An object can have a certain amount of enchantment added to it by using
     set_enchant. Values between 0 and 50 can be specified, and will improve
     the objects performance if it is a weapon or an armour. It also increases 
     the value of the object. Assigning an enchantment value to an object 
     automatically assigns a default octarine description for it as well.

     If a different description is required, the octarine_mess property should
     be used.
