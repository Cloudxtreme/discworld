mapping query_bonus_cache();

Description
.SP 5 5
To speed up the skill checking/querying functions several "caches" were
added to the living objects.  This one, the bonus cache, is for the
skill bonus calculation junk.  This function is mostly for debugging
use, and has no great relevance to the rest of the world.  It is being
docced cause I want to.  If anyone complains I will rip their heads
off.  I do so enjoy writing docs you know.
