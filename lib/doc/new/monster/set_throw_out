Name

set_throw_out - Sets the throw out stuff.
.EI

Syntax
.SI 5
void set_throw_out(int hps, int chance, 
                     string their_mess, string everyone_mess);
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
This sets the throw out variable.  If this is set, once any creature in the
room with the monster reaches a hp level of the hps variable or lower
it has a chance (equal to chance) of throwing them out of the room.  This
is checked every heart beat.  When this is done they
are told the message their_mess and everyone else sees everyone_mess.  It
uses expand_string on the messages, so all the normal expansions are
available for use...

The creatures will be thrown into a random nearby room, however if
the room has the property "no throw out" set to a non zero value then
the creature will not be thrown into it.
