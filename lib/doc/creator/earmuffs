Description
.SP 5 5
Earmuffs by itself displays information saying weather your earmuffs
are currently on or off, which events you have currently blocked and
the events you don't have blocked.

Earmuffs with just the on after it turns on the blocking.  All of the
events you have set to be blocked will be blocked from this time on,
you won't see them.  The off parameter turns off the blocking.  The
status of the blocking is independant of the actual events being blocked.

The last thing you can do with the command is turn on and off the blocking
of the various events.  If you don't specify on or off after the type the
value is toggled.  If you put an on or off there it is set to that value.
