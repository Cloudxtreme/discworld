Description

Set effective uid to `str'.  valid_seteuid() in master.c controls which
values the euid of an object may be set to.  The euid can always be set
to getuid() or 0.

When this value is 0, then current objects uid can be changed by
export_uid(), and only then.

But, when the value is 0, no objects can be loaded or cloned by this object.
