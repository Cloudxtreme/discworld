Name
.SI 5
cat - Catenate files.
.EI

Syntax
.SI 5
cat <file(s)>
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
Cat is used to display files.  As you cannot stop cat from inside the mud, it
will only display the first 40 lines of the files you display.  This can be
annoying, but if you need to see more, use the ed or more commands.  The files
can be specified either relative to your current directory or absolute from the
root dir.  *'s will be expanded.

Examples:
