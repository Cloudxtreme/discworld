Items are objects that players can look at in rooms.  In the long description
you might mention some candles that hang from the walls of the passage.  If you
don't add the item candles, it will complain that the candles are not here when
the player looks at them.  This is frustrating to say the least.  The item
consists of two parts.  The item, and the description.
