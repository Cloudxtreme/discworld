MAGIC and OCCULT have been amalgamated and restructured.  If you had any
levels in these before, you can get levels in the new skills by using
the MONOLITH in SATOR SQUARE.  WIZARDS should check on their guild
board to see what their PRIMARY skills are under the new system.

The Discworld FAQ is now available! Point your WWW browser at 
http://discworld.imaginary.com:5678/ to take a look at it or send email
to janger@rohan.sdsu.edu asking for a copy.

The non-quest WEAPONS have been overhauled to make the DAMAGES of each
a certain fraction of the damages available from quest weapons.  As a
result, NPCs will generally be significantly more DANGEROUS.  You have
been warned.

This SITE is currently in need of more MEMORY so that it can open to full
PLAYER capacity.  If you would like to contribute to the FUND, please
contact DEUTHA or SOJAN.

The TOP TEN TABLES now rank players according to a RATING based on SKILLS.
Please see the NEWSPAPER board for more information.

IMPORTANT!!!!!  Discworld is now running from im1.master.net.au
This site is far faster, I hope you enjoy your stay.
