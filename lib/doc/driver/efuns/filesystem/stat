Synopsis
.SI 5
mixed *stat(string str, int default: F_CONST0);

.EI
Description
.SP 5 5
If str is the name of a regular file (not a directory), then stat()
will return an array of information pertaining to that file.  The
form of the array is as follows:

   ({ file_size, last_time_file_touched, time_object_loaded })

If stat is called on a directory (not a regular file), then stat
behaves identically to get_dir().
