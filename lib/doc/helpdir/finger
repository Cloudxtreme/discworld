Description
.SP 5 5
  This will give you some information on the player or creator you have
fingered. It returns when they were last on, or since when they have
been logged on for, how long they have been idle for (if at all), their
email address (if they entered it), their birthday and how old their
character is. To change all the information use chfn.  The only other
modifyable stuff you can do is change guilds ;)

The wonderful .plan (and .project) can be set in your aliases.  ie to set
alias .plan You are a womble;Have fun

The ;'s in your .plan will be expanded to newlines

Without an argument, this command gives minimal info about all current
players, the second field is [G]od, [H]igh Lord, [L]ord, [C]reator or
[A]ppentice - normal players have no flag, and [X] means they haven't
entered the game yet, anyone can also be [e]earmuffed.
