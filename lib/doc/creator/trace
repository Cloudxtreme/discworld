Usage : trace [off|call|call_other|return|args|exec|heart_beat|apply|
               obj_name|numer]

Trace is used as a debugging tool.  It will print a debugging message every
time the event you specify occurs during the execution of a command that you
initiated.  To get some idea what is meant by this, try

trace call_other

and then type stat <yourself>.  This will show you all the functions that get
called using call_other to get the information for the command.

Examples:

trace call_other

trace return

trace off
