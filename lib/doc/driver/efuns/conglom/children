Description
.SP 5 5
This efunction returns an array of objects that have been cloned from
the file named by 'name'.  A typical use of children() is to find all objects
that have been cloned from the player object.  For example:

   object *list;

   list = children("/obj/player");

This lets you find all players (both netdead and interactive whereas users()
only reports interactive players).
