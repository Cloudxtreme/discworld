Description
.SP 5 5
This efun collects information gathered via the UNIX(tm) getrusage() system
call.  Read the getrusage() man page for more information on what information
will be collected.  Some systems do not have the getrusage() system call
but do have the times() system call.  On those systems, only "usertime"
and "stime" will be available (in units of clock ticks which are system
dependent).  If getrusage() is available, times will be reported in
milliseconds.

Here is an example usage of rusage():

  void
  create()
  {
      mapping info;

      info = rusage();
      write("user time = " + info["usertime"] + "ms\n");
      write("system time = " + info["stime"] + "ms\n");
  }

The available fields are:

usertime, stime, maxrss, ixrss, idrss, isrss, minflt, majflt, nswap, inblock,
oublock, msgsnd, msgrcv, nsignals, nvcsw, nivcsw.
