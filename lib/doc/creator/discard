Description
.SP 5 5
Discard is used to remove a loaded object from memory.  If you are working on
an object and are finished with it, you can help the mud reduce the amount of
memory it is using by discarding the object.  Do not discard objects that are
going to be used by other people as the mud will then have to load it again.
