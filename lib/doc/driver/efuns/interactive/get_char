get_char - causes next character of input to be sent to a specified function

.EI
Synopsis
.SI 5
varargs void get_char(string fun, int flag, ...);

.EI
Description
.SP 5 5
Enable next character of user input to be sent to the local function `fun' as
an argument. The input character will not be parsed by the driver.

Note that get_char is non-blocking which means that the object calling
get_char does not pause waiting for input.  Instead the object continues
to execute any statements following the input_to.  The specified function
'fun' will not be called until the user input has been collected.

If "get_char()" is called more than once in the same execution, only the
first call has any effect.

If optional argument `flag' is non-zero, the line given by the player will
not be echoed, and is not seen if snooped (this is useful for collecting
passwords).

The function 'fun' will be called with the user input as its first argument
(a string). Any additional arguments supplied to input_to will be passed on to
'fun' as arguments following the user input.

Bugs
.SI 5
Please note that get_char has a significant bug in MudOS 0.9 and
earlier.  On many systems with poor telnet negotiation (read: almost
every major workstation on the market), get_char makes screen output
behave strangely.  It is not recommended for common usage throughout
the mudlib until that bug is fixed.  (it is currently only known to
work well for users connecting from NeXT computers)
