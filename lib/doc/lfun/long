string long(string str, int dark)
 
        Returns the long description of the object.  This is what is used
when you "look at" an object.  The str is the string that was used in the
"look at" thingo.  So if the person typed "look at frog" str would be set
to frog.  The dark varible is set to 1 if the player object has decied that
it is dark.  This is based on the race you belong to.
 
NB:  It returns a string, is does not write to the screen.
