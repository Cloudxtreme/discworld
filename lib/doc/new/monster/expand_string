Description
.SP 5 5
This expands the incoming string using a set of $ enclosed macro
thingys.  The attacker is a fairly obvious argument :)  and the on
is used as an argument to the object expansion thingy, if it is not
set a random object is chosen.

There are expansions on several things, listed below:
.EP
.SO 5 5 -15
	l	Living object, randomly choosen from the environment.
	o	Object, randomly choosen from the environment.
	a	attacker.  Passed as a parameter.
	m	Me....
.EO
.SP 5 5


Each of these objects/thingys have a second bit to them that specifies
exactly what they are going to be.  They are
.EP
.SO 5 10 -20
	name	Name of the object.
	cname	Cap name of the object.
	gender	Gender string.
	poss	Possessive string.
	obj	Objective string.
	gtitle	Gender title.
	pronoun	Pronoun string.
.EO
.SP 5 5


Using these illustrious values the string will be expanded.
