find_match

object *find_match(string str, object|(object *)ob)

.SP 5 5
Returns an array of objects that match str, within the object ob or array
of objects ob. It checks the inventory of specified objects and 
returns the matching objects.

If it fails to match anything it returns the empty array.

Unlike present, str may not be an object, use present() *8-)*

If you are still confused the code is in /std/simul_efun.c
but if you understand it from that you are a better man/etc than I.
(Bit of bil humour there, of course it is understandable.  I wrote it :)
