string read_file(string file, int start_line, int end_line)
.SP 5 5
Reads lines of text from a file into a string.  For examples on how this
is useful, look at the grep code in the player object.

The string can then be sscanf'd, etc or manipulated in anyway seen fit.  The
start_line is the line number of the line you wish to read.  This routine
will return 0 if you try to read past the end of the file, or if you try to
read from a nonpositive line.
