Description
.SP 5 5
This function moves the object to the given destination.  The destination
can either be a string or an object.  All sort of things are checked on the
way like weather the object is already carrying to much, if you are not
allowed to move objects into the object and so on.  Weight and light are
also updated with this function.  The messin and messout variables are
printed if they are non zero.  However, they are not required to be set,
you can just call the function with the destination.

The function returns 0 if the move was successful or one of the move
failures from in move_failures.h
