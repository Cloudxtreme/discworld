bug [command/spell/object/room] [name]

Description
.SP 5 5
This command informs the creators of bugs in commands, spells, objects, and 
rooms.  The first argument is used to specify what type of bug is it, while 
the second is the name of the command, spell, or object.  The second argument 
is not used for rooms.  The default setting is for rooms, so if you ommit 
the arguments it will send the report to the room you are standing.

The error message is recorded in one central log file and a log file specific 
to the whatever you are using the command for.

To report errors in rooms just stand in them and use the command.

.SP 5 5
To report errors in objects be VERY SPECIFIC.  For example if you got three
swords, don't use 'bug object sword' because the error report will go to the 
first sword even if it's not the one with the error.  Instead, make sure 
which one is giving you the error and use something like 'bug object sword 2' 
or you can put it's full name, ie 'bug object sword of doom'.

To report errors in commands and spells, just put the name of the command, or
spell as the second argument.
