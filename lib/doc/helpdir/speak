Description
.SP 5 5
This command allows you to change the default spoken language.  At the
start you will only know common and grunt.  As time goes on you will
probably learn new languages.  The two start languages are special.  As
everyone knows common, and in fact is the default language you speak,
everyon can understand it.  This means speaking this language you have
a good chance of being understood.

Grunt is also a special language.  It is a language everyone can speak
but no one can understand.  So, if you speak grunt no one else will
understand you.  This is the language you will speak if you forget
all your others.

Languages have differnet properties, for example not all languages are
spoken, and not all languages are written.
