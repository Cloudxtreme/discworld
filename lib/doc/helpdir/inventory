Description
.SP 5 5
Inventory is used to look at the things you are carrying. It separates
what you are wielding, holding and wearing from your main equipment.
Unfortunately as things are clumped like this, and the objects are listed
in groups (eg "four daggers") there may be problems with identifying things as
eg "dagger 2". Be careful.
