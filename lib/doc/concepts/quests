Quests
.SP 5 5
Quests come in many shapes and forms.  Being a bold adventurer, you will wish
to add fame and fortune to your name.  To do this you can go on bold quests
for kings and knights.  Or you may simply become famous for your deeds in
helping the poor and miserable.  Quests are everywhere, lurking in every
nook and cranny.  You just have to find them.

Fame comes with quests.  There is a title on the end of your name that reflects
the boldest of your exploits.  Each quest is rated with a certain number of
points.  The hardest quest you have done will be reflected by your title.

Fortune comes with quests.  Many a quest will have a monetary reward.  You may
be endowed with powerful magical items to use in your quest.  You may be
allowed to keep them after the quest is complete.  You may recieve a bounty
for returning an outlaw or fugitive to justice.

Quests will also allow you to improve yourself.  Your stats are basically
static and cannot be improved without magical help.  As a reward for hard
quests, you may be endowed with bonuses to you stats.  Powerful mages and
thankful gods will bestow upon you great gifts.
