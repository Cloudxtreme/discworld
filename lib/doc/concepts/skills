Skills
.SP 5 5
Discworld uses a heirarchial skill system.  A player has a total of about 40-50
skills in which they improve and train.  The skills are broken up into groups.
All skills fall into fighting, magic, faith, etc.
The skills in magic are then divided up into spells, items, points and 
special.  This scheme procedes downwards until a skill is finally reached.
Your skill in fighting is the average of all the skills below fighting.
You can only advance skills that you have depth*5 skill levels in.  What is
meant by this is that you can only advance the top level fighting until you
reach level 5 at which point, you can advance fighting.combat or fighting.points
This means you can either get better at fighting or get more hit points.
Similarly when you get to level 10 in fighting, you can start to advance either
fighting.combat.melee or fighting.combat.dodging.  It is entirely up to you
what you want to advance in.

Other members in your guild should be able to tell you what sort of things you
should advance in to get certain abilities.
