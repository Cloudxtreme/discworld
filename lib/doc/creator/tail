Usage : tail <files>

Tail will print the last 30-40 lines of a file.  It is useful for checking
log files, or just checking files where you know the bit you want to look at
is on the end of the file.  The files are specified either relative to your
current path, or absolute from the root dir and will be expanded.

Examples:

tail /*debug.log
tail /log/ENTER /log/BUG /log/C*
tail ENTER
