query_skill_bonus - The working skill value.
.EI

Syntax
.SI 5
int query_skill_bonus(string skill);
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
This returns the value for the skill.  This is the value that is used in
calculation of skill success/failure.  This function takes into account
stats, level and guild/race bonuses.  This uses two of the caches.
The bonus cache and the stat cache.  The rough range for values returned
from this function is 0-300.  However values above 300 are possible,
just unlikely.  There is no theoretical limit on the value this function
can return.  But assume that 300 means they are an amazing master
of the skill.

When writing skill success checking functions, please make sure you
don't use a static cut off.  Try and make things random, so that as the
player gets better at something he succeeds more often, but not that
often...
