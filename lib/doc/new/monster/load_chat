load_chat - Random chat messages.
.EI

Syntax
.SI 5
void load_chat(int chance, mixed *mess);
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
This loads up the default chat messages.  The chance is the chance in
1000 that one of the messages will show up every heart_beat whilst
not in combat.  The
mess array is actualy made up of pairs.  Each pair consists of a weight
and a message.  The weight is designed to allow you to make some
messages much more likely to be said than others.  The mesage can
actualy be several things.  If the message starts with a ' it is a say,
if it starts with a " it is a loud say.  If it starts with an @ it is a
soul command.  If it starts with a : it is an emote.  If it starts with
none of the above it acts like an echo.

All of the strings are parsed through expand_string first.  There is another
option for the messages bit.  It can be an array.  If it is an array then
the message is a story and it will say the entire story in its entirity
from the start to the end before chooseing a new random message
to say.  Each message in the story has the same options as a normal
message (except you cannot have nested storys).

Some help, if the starting character is:
.EP
.SO 5 5 -15
	@	Soul command
	'	Say.
	"	Loud say.
	:	Emote.
	default	echo.
.EO
