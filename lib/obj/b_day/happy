Origami demon takes a deep breath...
Origami demon sings: Happy Birthday to you,
Origami demon sings: Happy Birthday to you,
Origami demon sings: Happy Birthday dear $N,
Origami demon pauses for breath...
Origami demon sings: Happy Birthday to you.
Origami demon sings: The end!
Origami demon hugs you, in a way only a tiny paper demon could.
Origami demon waves a minute pointed hand.
The demon frowns, then folds itself into nothingness...
