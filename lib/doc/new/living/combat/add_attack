Name
.SI 5
add_attack - Add a specific attack to an object.
.EI

Syntax
.SI 5
add_attack( [see below] );
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
add_attack can be used to add a specific attack to a weapon, monster or
any other object that ever gets into a fight.

Ok, add_attack has quite a few arguments in it, so instead of putting it in
syntax i'll detail them below with examples..

	1.	This argument must be a string and defines the name of the attack, as  it will be called in write_message. i.e. "slash", or "cripple".
	2.	This is very confusing and should remain at 0, preferably.
	3.	The percentage chance of happening. This does NOT mean that if you have three add_attacks they need be set at say 20,40,40 as they could all be at 100,100,100 and still work, it is their own percentage chance.
	4.	This is the inital damage in hit points and, using an array, you can do a funky AD&D dice thing. For example to do 100 hps + 5-10 sided dice it would be ({ 100 , 5 , 10 }). giving anything between 105 and 150 hps damage.
	5.	This is the percent chance of doing additional damage on a successful strike. I.e. 100 to always do additional damage.
	6.	this is the amount of damage done by the additional attack, the same array rule applies as above.
	7.	this is the type of damage done. I.e. "slash", "blunt", "heat", etc..

Example
.SI 5
add_attack("whack", 0 , 40 , ({ 30 , 5 , 20 }) , 10 , 50 , "blunt")

.EI
.SP 5 5
This will add an attack "whack", with 40% chance of happening, doing 30hps
plus 5D20 extra and a 10% chance of doing an extra 50hps. The attack will be 
of blunt type. Simple no? No, I didn't think so..
