Name

query_no_check - Querys the no check flag.
.EI

Syntax
.SI 5
void query_no_check(int val);
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
This querys the no check flag to the value passed.  The no check flag is
used to stop the stat changes calling the recalculate functions all
of the time.  This was done because when queryting a monster it was not
unusual to call query_hp, and a few adjust_bonus_hps here and there.
Each of these used to generate a new update routine to recalculate values.
This made the monsters over evaluate in a big way.  This is the fix.
Use it for whatever you can think of.
