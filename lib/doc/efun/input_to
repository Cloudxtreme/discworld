void input_to(string fun, int flag)

.SP 5 5
Enable next line of user input to be sent to the local function fun as
an argument. The input line will not be parsed.

Note that fun is not called immediately. It will not be called until the 
current execution has terminated, and the player has given a new command.

If input_to() is called more than once in the same execution, only the first 
call has any effect.

If optional argument flag is non-zero, the line given by the player will not 
be echoed, and is not seen if snooped.
