Stats
.SP 5 5
The stat system on discworld revolves around the 5 important stats of your body.
While some people may argue that there are more important stats, or that ones
we use are not appropriate, we don't give a hedgehog.  Our system works well
enough with the ones given.

The stats that each living thing has are Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom,
Dexterity and Constitution.  Strength is physical strength and build.  The 
stronger you are, the more you can carry.  Intelligence is mental capacity.
The more intelligent you are, the better you will learn and manipulate magic.
Wisdom in mental discipline.  The better your wisdom, the more you will be able
to concentrate on your god and ask for its help.  Dexterity is a general agility
and manual dexterity skill.  The higher this skill, the better your reactions,
the better you are at fine motor tasks etc.  Constitution is your internal
fortitude.  If you have a high constitution, you will have more hit points, be
less susseptible to poisons etc.

The stats work in the following way.  When you first log into the mud, you will
have stats of 13 13 13 13 13.  You will be able to reallocate these once.  This
is how you can make your character the way you want it.  The stats will have a
minimum value of 8.  You cannot have a stat less than 8 normally.  The stats
are represented by the following (D&Dish) scheme.

8, 9, 10, ..., 17, 18, 18/10, 18/20, ..., 18/90, 18/00.

These are the limit of stats obtainable normally.  After you go above 18, the
gap of 18/10 to 18/20 is equivilant to the distance between 17 and 18.  The
distance between all stats is equal.

By finding powerful talismans and artifacts, or just potions and objects, you
will be able to modify your stats temporarily or permenantly.  Permenant stat
changes are very rare and will usually require a long and hard quest to make
it possible.

Through magical means, it is possible to push your stats over the 18/00 limit.
After 18/00, the original scheme resumes with normal numbers leading from 19
upwards on an open ended scale.
