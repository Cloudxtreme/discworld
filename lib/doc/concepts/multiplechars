  I believe the MU in MUD stand for Multi and User respectively.  As such,
the environment of the mud allows real people to interact with other real
people in a fantasy or theme environment.  Logging multiple characaters
to better yourself either by giving money, equipment or skills,
equipment, or skills, detracts from this somewhat.
  Simply defined, it would be cheating.  Therefore any infringement would
result in removal of all your characters.
