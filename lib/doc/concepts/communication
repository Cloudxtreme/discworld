Communication

.SP 5 5
There are several ways of communicating on the mud.  The most common of these
is say.  Say tells everybody in the room with you, whatever it is that you
type after say.  There is also tell which tells one person specifically
something.  And then there is shout which tells everybody something.  The other
way of communicating are through soul commands and emoting.  The soul commands
are to add atmosphere and flavour to your conversations.  If someone says
something really funny, rather than just typing 'thats funny', you can type
laugh which will tell everyone that you fall down laughing.  Emoting is similar
except that you can do any action, rather than just the ones that are defined
in the soul.  There are also the commands echo, echoto and echoall.  Echo gives
everyone in the room the message you type, but it is not clear who it is
coming from.  It is just as though something had happened and it was telling
you about it.  Echoto is the same, but it only sends it to a particular person.
Similarly, echoall sends the message to everybody on the mud.  For more
information on all of this, read the help files on the following commands.
