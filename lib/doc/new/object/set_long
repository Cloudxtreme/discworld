Description
.SP 5 5
The long description of the object is the description you see when you
look at it or examine it.  The long description is passed through a
couple of filters before the player gets to see it.  One of the filters
is process_string() and the other is the colour filters.  So you can
make parts of your long description trigger functions or look
different colours.
