Description
.SP 5 5
To speed up the skill checking/querying functions several "caches" were
added to the living objects.  This one, the stat cache, is for the
skill level calculation junk.  This function is mostly for debugging
use, and has no great relevance to the rest of the world.  Unlike the
other two cache's this is not a straight number, it is an array
containing a number and the stat string.  Not that it matters much.
