Synopsis

#include <socket.h>
#include <socket_errors.h>

int socket_accept(int s, string close_callback, string write_callback)

Description
.SP 5 5
The argument s is a socket that has been created with socket_create(3),
bound to an address with socket_bind(3), and is listening for connections
after a socket_listen(3). socket_accept() extracts the first connection
on the queue of pending connections, creates a new socket with the same
properties of s and allocates a new file descriptor for the socket. If no
pending connections are present on the queue, socket_accept() returns an
error as described below. The accepted socket is used to read and write data
to and from the socket which connected to this one; it is not used to accept
more connections. The original socket s remains open for accepting further
connections.

The argument close_callback is the name of a function for the driver to
call if the socket closes unexpectedly, i.e. not as the result of a
socket_close(3) call. The close callback should follow this format:

void close_callback(int fd)

Where fd is the socket which has closed.

The argument write_callback is the name of a function for the driver to
call when the new socket (not the accepting socket) is ready to be
written to. The write callback should follow this format:

void write_callback(int fd)

Where fd is the socket which is ready to be written to.

Return values
.SI 5
socket_accept() returns a non-negative descriptor for the accepted
socket on success. On failure, it returns a negative value. socket_error(3)
can be used on the return value to get a text description of the error.
