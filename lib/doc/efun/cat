int cat(string path, int start, int num)

.SP 5 5
List the file found at path. It is not legal to have '.' or spaces
in the path. This function is normally connected to the cat command
that wizards have. It is also used by the help command. The optional
arguments start and num is start line number, and number of lines.
If they are not given, the whole file is printed from the beginning.

The total number lines will not exceed a system limit, which normally
is 40 lines.

cat() returns 1 if success, 0 if no such file or no such lines.
