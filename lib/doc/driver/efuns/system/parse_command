parse_command() - parse commands given in a string

Synopsis
.SI 5
int parse_command(string str, object source, string pattern, var1, var2 ...);

.EI
Description
.SP 5 5
Parses commands given in `str' against the pattern in `pattern' and
returns 1 if it matches. `source' is either an object or an array of objects.
This is essentially a 'hotted' sscanf and it has a similar syntax, although
parse_command works on word basis where sscanf works on character basis.

`str'
      Given command.
`source'
      source is either an object or an array of objects.
       array
     
            array holding the accessible objects
           object
     
            object from which to recurse and create
            the list of accessible objects, normally
            ob = environment(this_player())
 
`pattern'
      Parsepattern as list of words and formats:
       word
     
            obligatory text (One word)
           [word]
     
            optional text (One word)
           /
     
            Alternative marker
           %o
     
            Single item, object
           %l
     
            Single living object
           %s
     
            Any text (multiple words)
           %w
     
            Any word
           %p
     
            Preposition
           %i
     
            Any items
           %d
     
            Number 0- or tx(0-99)
       Example string: " 'get' / 'take' %i "
      Items as in %o and %i be can on many forms. Some examples:
      apple, two apples, twentyfirst apple
      apples, all apples, all green apples, all green ones

`varN'
      This is the list of result variables as in sscanf.
      One variable is needed for each %_
      The return types of different %_ are:
       %o
     
            Returns an object
           %l
     
            Returns an object
           %s
     
            Returns a string of words
           %w
     
            Returns a string of one word
           %p
     
            Can on entry hold a list of word in array
            or an empty variable
            Returns:
            if empty variable: a string
            if array: array[0]=matched word
           %i
     
            Returns a special array on the form:
            [0] = (int) given numeric prefix
                =0: all or a pluralform given
                >0: numeral given: two, three, four...
                <0: order given: second, third ...
            [1..n] (object) Objectpointers
                A list of the POSSIBLE objects that can match
                the given %i. No choosing of third or such.
           %d
     
            Returns a number
 Example:
a = parse_command("take apple",environment(this_player()),
	 " 'get' / 'take' %i ",items);
