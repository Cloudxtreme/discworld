call_other() - call a function in another object

Synopsis
.SI 5
unknown call_other( object ob, string str, mixed arg );

.EI
Description
.SP 5 5
Call function in another object with an argument. The return value is
returned from the other object. The compiler don't know the return type,
so it must be cast.

There is a syntactically more attractive way to do call_others:

ob -> func( args... );

Which is equivalent to call_other( "func", args... );
If the first argument passed to call_other() is an array, then "func"
will be called on each element of the array which is an object.  Here
are some example usages of this MudOS feature:

all_inventory(ob)->move(dest);

users()->quit();
