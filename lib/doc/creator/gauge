Name

gauge - How long does this command take?
.EI

Syntax
.SI 5
gauge <command>
.EI

Description
.SP 5 5
This command is useful for testing commands to see how CPU-friendly or
unfriendly they are. It returns the evaluation cost measured in CPU cycles.
It is more useful for administrators, but could be useful if you are unsure
of the most efficient way to program something in.

The gauge command itself takes about 1500 cycles and this is not included
in the message it gives you. This means you should not use gauge too much,
as it is in itself a CPU user.
