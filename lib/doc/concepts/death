Death
.SP 5 5
Two things in life are certain.  One is taxes and the other is Death.  While
playing on the mud you will undoubtedly receive many a visit from this fine
fellow, well skeleton, and he really isn't that bad.  You don't actually lose
much by dying.  It is basically punishment for being cocky and overenthusiastic.

Once you reach the afterlife, death will be there to welcome you.  He is a busy
person and can only be in one place at a time, so if things are busy, you may
have to wait a few minutes.  Once death has said his bit you are free to go
and have yourself raised from the dead.  While dead, there are a number of
things that you cannot do.  One of these is sadly casting spells, so you will
not be able to raise yourself from the dead.  To be raised, you will have to
go and find yourself a cleric NPC or player who is high enough level and get
them to restore you to your former self.

Be prepared to pay for ressurection.  Some chappies may be nice, but others
may demand favours or monetary reward for their services.
